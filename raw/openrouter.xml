<title><![CDATA[Relace: Relace Search (relace/relace-search)]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[The relace-search model uses 4-12 `view_file` and `grep` tools in parallel to explore a codebase and return relevant files to the user request. 

In contrast to RAG, relace-search performs agentic multi-step reasoning to produce highly precise results 4x faster than any frontier model. It's designed to serve as a subagent that passes its findings to an "oracle" coding agent, who orchestrates/performs the rest of the coding task.

To use relace-search you need to build an appropriate agent harness, and parse the response for relevant information to hand off to the oracle. Read more about it in the <a href="https://docs.relace.ai/docs/fast-agentic-search/agent">Relace documentation</a>.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[TNG-R1T-Chimera is an experimental LLM with a faible for creative storytelling and character interaction. It is a derivate of the original TNG/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera released in April 2025 and is available exclusively via Chutes and OpenRouter.

Characteristics and improvements include:

We think that it has a creative and pleasant personality.
It has a preliminary EQ-Bench3 value of about 1305.
It is quite a bit more intelligent than the original, albeit a slightly slower.
It is much more think-token consistent, i.e. reasoning and answer blocks are properly delineated.
Tool calling is much improved.

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.

In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.

<title><![CDATA[Qwen: Qwen3 Next 80B A3B Thinking (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking)]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking is a reasoning-first chat model in the Qwen3-Next line that outputs structured “thinking” traces by default. It’s designed for hard multi-step problems; math proofs, code synthesis/debugging, logic, and agentic planning, and reports strong results across knowledge, reasoning, coding, alignment, and multilingual evaluations. Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive or off-task behavior.

The model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Qwen: Qwen3 Next 80B A3B Instruct (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct)]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct is an instruction-tuned chat model in the Qwen3-Next series optimized for fast, stable responses without “thinking” traces. It targets complex tasks across reasoning, code generation, knowledge QA, and multilingual use, while remaining robust on alignment and formatting. Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.

The model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[DeepHermes 3 (Mistral 24B Preview) is an instruction-tuned language model by Nous Research based on Mistral-Small-24B, designed for chat, function calling, and advanced multi-turn reasoning. It introduces a dual-mode system that toggles between intuitive chat responses and structured “deep reasoning” mode using special system prompts. Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.

DeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *"deep thinking"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. 

System Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

<description><![CDATA[Caller Large is Arcee's specialist "function‑calling" SLM built to orchestrate external tools and APIs. Instead of maximizing next‑token accuracy, training focuses on structured JSON outputs, parameter extraction and multi‑step tool chains, making Caller a natural choice for retrieval‑augmented generation, robotic process automation or data‑pull chatbots. It incorporates a routing head that decides when (and how) to invoke a tool versus answering directly, reducing hallucinated calls. The model is already the backbone of Arcee Conductor's auto‑tool mode, where it parses user intent, emits clean function signatures and hands control back once the tool response is ready. Developers thus gain an OpenAI‑style function‑calling UX without handing requests to a frontier‑scale model. ]]></description>

Compared to the earlier 7 B preview, the production 32 B release widens the context window to 128 k tokens and doubles pass‑rate on MATH and GSM‑8K, while also lifting code completion accuracy. Its instruction style encourages structured "thought → answer" traces that can be parsed or hidden according to user preference. That transparency pairs well with audit‑focused industries like finance or healthcare where seeing the reasoning path matters. In Arcee Conductor, Maestro is automatically selected for complex, multi‑constraint queries that smaller SLMs bounce. ]]></description>

Training blended DeepSeek R1 distillation, multi‑epoch supervised fine‑tuning and a final DPO/RLHF alignment stage, yielding strong performance on BIG‑Bench‑Hard, GSM‑8K and long‑context Needle‑In‑Haystack tests. Enterprises use Virtuoso‑Large as the "fallback" brain in Conductor pipelines when other SLMs flag low confidence. Despite its size, aggressive KV‑cache optimizations keep first‑token latency in the low‑second range on 8× H100 nodes, making it a practical production‑grade powerhouse.]]></description>

The distillation‑plus‑refinement pipeline trims compute while keeping DeepSeek‑style reasoning, so Blitz punches above its weight on MMLU, GSM‑8K and BBH compared with other mid‑size open models. With a default 128 k context window and competitive throughput, it serves as a cost‑efficient workhorse for summarization, brainstorming and light code help. Internally, Arcee uses Blitz as the default writer in Conductor pipelines when the heavier Virtuoso line is not required.

<description><![CDATA[Llama Guard 4 is a Llama 4 Scout-derived multimodal pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM—generating text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.

Llama Guard 4 was aligned to safeguard against the standardized MLCommons hazards taxonomy and designed to support multimodal Llama 4 capabilities. Specifically, it combines features from previous Llama Guard models, providing content moderation for English and multiple supported languages, along with enhanced capabilities to handle mixed text-and-image prompts, including multiple images. Additionally, Llama Guard 4 is integrated into the Llama Moderations API, extending robust safety classification to text and images.]]></description>

It supports function calling for search and navigation primitives (`search`, `click`, `open`, `finish`), enabling use in agent-style pipelines. Rumination behavior is governed by multi-turn loops with rule-based reward shaping and delayed decision mechanisms, benchmarked against Deep Research frameworks such as OpenAI’s internal alignment stacks. This variant is suitable for scenarios requiring depth over speed.]]></description>

Transparent "thinking" traces accessible. Defaults to low reasoning, can boost with setting `reasoning: { effort: "high" }`

Note: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add `provider: { sort: throughput}`, to sort by throughput instead.

<title><![CDATA[Perplexity: Sonar Deep Research (perplexity/sonar-deep-research)]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Sonar Deep Research is a research-focused model designed for multi-step retrieval, synthesis, and reasoning across complex topics. It autonomously searches, reads, and evaluates sources, refining its approach as it gathers information. This enables comprehensive report generation across domains like finance, technology, health, and current events.

Notes on Pricing (<a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#detailed-pricing-breakdown-for-sonar-deep-research">Source</a>) 
- Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches)
- Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.
- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Llama Guard 3 is a Llama-3.1-8B pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.

Llama Guard 3 was aligned to safeguard against the MLCommons standardized hazards taxonomy and designed to support Llama 3.1 capabilities. Specifically, it provides content moderation in 8 languages, and was optimized to support safety and security for search and code interpreter tool calls.

<description><![CDATA[DBRX is a new open source large language model developed by Databricks. At 132B, it outperforms existing open source LLMs like Llama 2 70B and <a href="/models/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b">Mixtral-8x7b</a> on standard industry benchmarks for language understanding, programming, math, and logic.

It uses a fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. 36B parameters are active on any input. It was pre-trained on 12T tokens of text and code data. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts.

<description><![CDATA[This is a 16k context fine-tune of <a href="/models/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b">Mixtral-8x7b</a>. It excels in coding tasks due to extensive training with coding data and is known for its obedience, although it lacks DPO tuning.

The model is uncensored and is stripped of alignment and bias. It requires an external alignment layer for ethical use. Users are cautioned to use this highly compliant model responsibly, as detailed in a blog post about uncensored models at <a href="https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models">erichartford.com/uncensored-models</a>.

<description><![CDATA[The v2 of <a href="/models/jebcarter/psyfighter-13b">Psyfighter</a> - a merged model created by the KoboldAI community members Jeb Carter and TwistedShadows, made possible thanks to the KoboldAI merge request service.

The intent was to add medical data to supplement the model's fictional ability with more details on anatomy and mental states. This model should not be used for medical advice or therapy because of its high likelihood of pulling in fictional data.

It's a merge between:
